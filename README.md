# Boids in Vanilla JS Using Canvas
  In this project I implemented the boid algorithm which simulates the flocking behaviour of birds. 
## Usage
You must include the script boidsMain.js and link boids.cssin your html file. Also, include the canvas element with the id 'boidsCanvas'.
```     
   <head>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="boids.css">
        <script type="module" src="boidsMain.js"></script>
    </head>
    <body>
        <canvas id="boidsCanvas"></canvas>
    </body>
```
## Example
An example of the animation is on my personal website <http://www.jakenieto.com>. If you click the background a new flock of boids
is generated. 

## Inspiration
I got my inspiration for this project here <https://p5js.org/examples/simulate-flocking.html>.
